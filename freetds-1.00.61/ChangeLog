    Extends cs_dt_crack to support newer types

    This add a new cs_dt_crack_v2 ABI function (cs_dt_crack API is redirected
    to it using a preprocessor macro). This to make the extension of
    CS_DATEREC more safe (version of 1.0 could call cs_dt_crack with
    CS_BIGDATETIME_TYPE/CS_BIGTIME_TYPE without having these fields written
    which would possible cause memory corruption on version compiled with
    these fields missing).
    This make sqsh compile and work with newer date/time types.

    This was an old function used to get the address of an host.
    Was used before supporting IPv6 and getaddrinfo to have a reentrant
    gethostbyname.
    Now is used only in systems where getaddrinfo is not present to
    implement a getaddrinfo replacement function.
    So code is moved in getaddrinfo replacement file and function made
    static.
